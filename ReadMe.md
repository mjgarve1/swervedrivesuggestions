Here is a place where you can go into more details about code implementation.

This would be able to document each file, each function, etc... in a more human readable format.

Doing it this way would allow for the code to have documentation for what the code is doing without bloating the code file with way too many comments.

**(Pro tip, in the top right of the tabs there is an icon that looks like two rectangles with a magnifying glass and you can see what the readme looks like in Github)**

# Files

## RobotContainer.java

This file implements the initialization of robot functions, such as:
* Subsystems
* Commands
* OI
* etc...

## Robot.java

Don't mess with this file if you don't know exactly why you are messing with it, this is the FRC way of controlling the robot.
